## Prerequisites

To run this application, you need:

- Node.js installed on your machine
- MetaMask browser extension installed
- Access to an Ethereum network (such as Rinkeby, Ropsten, or a local development network like Ganache)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Update the contract address:

   Replace `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `index.html` with the address of your deployed smart contract.

## Usage

1. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the frontend.

3. Connect MetaMask to your desired Ethereum network.

4. Use the interface to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds according to the contract's functionalities.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: HTML file containing the frontend interface.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file containing Web3.js interactions with the smart contract.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the frontend interface.
